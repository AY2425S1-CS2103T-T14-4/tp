## Quick start {#quick-start}

### 1. Install Java 

Make sure you have **Java 17 or above** installed on your computer. You may skip this step if you already have it installed.

Installing Java:

* Download Java [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html). Follow the instructions on that page to install Java.

### 2. Download the AgentAssist application

Go to this [link](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/releases) and download the latest version of the `.jar` file.

### 3. Choose a Folder

Find or create a folder on your computer where you want to store the AgentAssist information. <br>
Move the `.jar` file you just downloaded into this folder.

### 4. Open a Command Terminal

Now, open a command terminal:

* On Windows, press the **Windows Key** and type **`Command Prompt`** in the search bar. Click on the **Command Prompt** application to open it.
* On macOS, press **Cmd + Space**, type **`Terminal`** into the search bar, and press **Enter**.
* On Linux, open your Terminal application.

### 5. Run the applicaton

Navigate your terminal to the folder where you saved the AgentAssist application:

* Type **`cd `** (with a space after it), then drag and drop the folder where you placed the `.jar` file into the terminal window. The command should look similar to this: `cd '/Users/name/AgentAssistFolder'`. Press Enter.<br>

Type the following command: **`java -jar agentassist.jar`** and press **Enter**.

* A window similar to the below image should appear in a few seconds. You will see a graphical user interface with sample contact information already added.<br>

## Using AgentAssist {#using-agentassist}

AgentAssist's command box is your portal to managing contacts efficiently. Here’s how you can use it to streamline your tasks:

* To get started, simply type a command into the command box and hit **Enter**.

Some initial commands to try:


- **Viewing Contacts**
  * `list`: This command displays all contacts currently in your database, making it easy to browse through entries.

- **Adding a New Contact**
  * `add n/Jane Doe p/87654321 e/jane@example.com a/123 Jane Road j/doctor i/120000`: Adds Jane Doe to your database with detailed contact info, occupation, and income.

- **Editing a Contact**
  * `edit 1 p/12345678`: Updates the phone number of the first contact in your list to `12345678`.
  * `edit 4 rn/Updated remarks here`: Replaces the remarks of the fourth contact with "Updated remarks here".

- **Removing a Contact**
  * `delete 3`: Removes the third contact from your list. Ensure you have the correct index to avoid deleting the wrong entry.

- **Searching for a Contact**
  * `filter n/Jane`: Finds all contacts named Jane in your database. It’s a powerful tool for quickly locating entries.

- **Getting Help**
  * `help`: Opens a help dialog that provides a summary of all available commands and their usage.


**Pro Tip:** Experiment with combining commands like `filter` followed by `edit` or `delete` to manage your contacts more effectively. For example, use `filter j/doctor` to display all doctors, then `edit 2 a/321 New Address` to update the address for the second listed doctor.

The GUI will dynamically update to show the results of your commands, making it easy to see the impact of your actions in real time.

Refer to the [Features](#features-overview) section for more detailed instructions on each command.

### Feature 5: Find a Customer by Details {#find-a-customer-by-details}

**Purpose:**  
This feature allows users to search for customers by specific details such as name, address, email, phone number, job title, or remarks. 

**How to Use It:**  
To perform a search, use the `filter` command followed by one or more flags (indicating the fields to search) and the corresponding search terms. 
 Searches are **case-insensitive** and use [**substring-matching**](#substring-matching), **except for Tier**, which must start with the specified substring.

- **Command Format:** 
  ```
  filter <FLAG>/ <SEARCH TERM> [<ADDITIONAL FLAGS>/ <SEARCH TERM>]
  ```
- **Examples:** 
  - Filter customers by name: 
    ```
    filter n/ TAN LESHEW
    ```

| Parameter   | Expected Format                                                                                              | Explanation                                                                                     |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FLAG        | Refer to the list of supported flags detailed below.                                                         | Identifies the field to search (e.g., `n/` for name, `j/` for job).                             |                                                                          |
| SEARCH TERM | Refer to the syntax constraints in the [parameter subsection of the `add` command](#add-command-parameters). | The value to search for in the specified field (e.g., "doctor" for job, "TAN LESHEW" for name). |

#### Supported flags:
- `n/` for Name
- `p/` for Phone Number
- `e/` for Email
- `a/` for Address
- `j/` for Job
- `r/` for Remarks
- `t/` for Tier

#### Substring Matching:
- Substring matching is used for searches, meaning that the search term must match a part of the field in the same order as it appears in the customer record.
- For instance, if a customer’s name is `Gordon Moore`, the search term `Gordon`, `Moore`, or `Gordon Moore` will match, but `Moore Gordon` will not.

#### What to Expect
- **If Successful:**
  - Message: "`x` person listed!", where `x` is the number of matching results.
- **If Unsuccessful (No Matches Found):**
  - Message: "0 persons listed!"
- **If There is an Error:** 
  - No Valid Flags Used:
    - Message:
    
      "filter: Searches for all customers whose specified field contains the given substring (case-insensitive) and displays the results in a numbered list.
    
      Parameters: `<FLAG>/ <SEARCH TERM>`
      
      Flags: `n/` (name), `p/` (phone), `e/` (email), `a/` (address), `j/` (job), `r/` (remarks)
      
      Example: `filter n/ Alice p/ 91112222`

      This will find all customers whose names contain 'Alice' and has phone number '91112222'."

  - Search Term Fails to Meet Requirement (i.e. Phone Number longer than 8 digits):
    - The system will display usage hints specific to the first invalid search term.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ {#faq}

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.<br>

**Q**: How do I change the remarks or credit card tier of an existing customer?<br>
**A**: Use the [`edit`](#feature-4-edit-the-existing-customer) command, and specify the corresponding `t/` and or `rn/` or `ra/` flag to change these two fields.<br>

**Q**: Why am I getting an error when trying to edit the remark of an existing customer?<br>
**A**: Besides making sure that the command syntax is correct, please note that the `rn/` and `ra/` flags cannot be used together, as `rn/` is used to provide a new remark that will override any existing remark. Whilst, `ra/` will append a given remark to any existing remark.

**Q**: What do the different tier colors represent in the UI?  
**A**: Each credit card tier is visually distinguished in the UI: Gold is marked with a gold banner, Silver with a silver banner, Bronze with a bronze banner, and Reject with a red banner. This makes it easy to see at a glance the tier of each customer.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues {#known-issues}

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
