### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Client` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AgentAssistParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a client).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AgentAssistParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AgentAssistParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
  * `FilterCommandParser` performs an additional task: it creates multiple predicate classes, which are combined into a `CombinedPredicate`.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `FilterCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Client` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueClientList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Client` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AgentAssistStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 1. Add Command

### 2. Edit Command

### 3. Delete Command





## **Planned enhancements**

### 1. Multi-Language Support
**Current Issue:** Non-English text input can cause visual bugs, including reversed text display.

**Proposed Solution:** Replace the default system font with a universal font that supports multiple languages. See [this reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42854957/javafx-strange-space-characters-in-arabic) for implementation details.

### 2. Support for Forward Slash in Names
**Current Issue:** Names containing forward slashes (e.g., "Ramesh s/o Ravichandran") are incompatible with `add`, `edit`, and `filter` commands due to two problems:

1. The parser misinterprets "s/o" as a Status flag command, resulting in an invalid status error
2. The name validation regex explicitly blocks forward slashes to prevent parsing conflicts

**Technical Impact:**
- Allowing forward slashes would create ambiguous parsing scenarios
- Example of resulting error message:
  ![Confusing error message](images/PlannedEnhancementBug1.png)

**Status:** Implementation deferred to a future release due to the complexity of potential solutions and risk of introducing new bugs.

### 3. Data Import/Export Functionality
**Current issue:** Users must manually copy and paste the `agentassist.json` file in the `data` directory, if they wish to use others' agentassist data files, or share their data files with other users.

**Proposed Enhancement:** Add UI buttons in the application menu for:
- Importing data files
- Exporting data files

**Status:** Scheduled for future release as current manual process provides a workable solution.

### 4. Error Message Improvement
**Current issue:** Error messages are inconsistent when users input incorrect values. Depending on the parameter that is incorrect, the messages vary in detail. For example:
- ![img.png](images/incorrectPhoneEditError.png)
- ![differentEditError.png](images/differentEditError.png)
- ![editErrorWithHint.png](images/editErrorWithHint.png)
These images illustrate varying error message formats for the edit command. While some messages provide the full command hint, others offer minimal guidance, leading to inconsistency across commands. This issue extends beyond the edit command, as other commands also lack a standardized level of information in error messages. Some messages only indicate the error, while others include additional guidance, by also displaying the command hint.

Additionally, certain command hints could benefit from more clarity on constraints, especially for the `edit` command, which currently does not indicate that the `rn/` and `ra/` flags cannot be used simultaneously.

**Proposed Enhancement:** Standardize error message types and improve command hints:
- `Incorrect command format` type error messages - Triggered when required flags are missing..
  - Message format: 'Incorrect command format' + command hint.
- `Invalid flag values` type error messages - Triggered when all necessary flags are present, but one or more flag values are invalid.
  - Message format: Flag-specific error messages + command hint.
- Clarify edit command hint â€“ Add information on the constraint preventing simultaneous use of rn/ and ra/ flags.

**Status:** Scheduled for future release as the current error messages are still usable and help guide the user. Reason being:
1. Current error messages adequately inform users. However, standardisation will enhance usability by reducing confusion and improving consistency. 
2. The restriction on rn/ and ra/ flags is documented in the user guide, and an error is displayed when both flags are used together, thus users can learn of this constraint through multiple channels.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Banking Agents, that sell credit cards**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* needs a fast way to access data, and see relevant client information at a glance while on a call with the client
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

- **Description**: AgentAssist must be operational on any mainstream operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) as long as Java 17 or newer is installed.

#### Performance and Capacity
- **Description**: The system should efficiently handle up to 1000 client records without noticeable sluggishness in typical usage scenarios.
- **Performance Goal**: All commands should execute and return a response within two seconds to maintain a fluid user experience.

#### User Efficiency
- **Description**: Designed for users with above-average typing speed in regular English text; such users should find executing tasks via commands faster than using a mouse.

#### System Architecture
- **Description**: AgentAssist is designed for single-user scenarios, ensuring clientalized and secure data management without the complexities of multi-user capabilities.

#### Data Management
- **Description**: All client data should be stored locally in a human-editable text file format, allowing for easy access and manual modifications if required.

#### Documentation
- **Description**: Provide comprehensive, easy-to-read User and Developer Guides detailing functionality, usage, and system requirements.
- **Additional**: Both guides should be formatted to be printer-friendly, particularly in PDF format, facilitating easy distribution and referencing.

#### Installation and Distribution
- **Description**: AgentAssist should be accessible without the need for a traditional installer. The application should be distributable as a single JAR file, simplifying setup and use.
- **Dependency**: The software should operate independently without requiring connections to any remote servers owned or managed by the developer.

#### User Interface
- **Description**: While the primary interface is command-line based, any graphical user interface (GUI) elements should be optimized for standard screen resolutions (1920x1080 and higher) and screen scales (100% and 125%), ensuring clarity and usability across various devices.


### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Common operating systems like Windows, Linux, Unix, and macOS supported by the application.
* **CLI (Command Line Interface)**: A text-based interface where users interact with the app by typing commands instead of using a graphical interface (mouse-driven).
* **Banking Agent**: A user of the system responsible for selling credit cards to clients.
* **Contact**: A record in the AgentAssist system that contains cliental and financial details of a client.
* **Client**: An individual whose information is managed within the AgentAssist system. This client may be a prospective or existing customer of the banking agent, expressing interest in or currently using credit card services.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

    1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

    1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

    1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

    1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

1. _{ more test cases â€¦â€‹ }_

### Deleting a client

1. Deleting a client while all clients are being shown

    1. Prerequisites: List all clients using the `list` command. Multiple clients in the list.

   2. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
       Expected: A prompt for confirmation from the user is given. If the user provides confirmation, the first contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Otherwise, the user is informed that the command has been cancelled, and no change is made.

   3. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
       Expected: An error message is shown to the user. No client is deleted. Error details shown in the status message.

   4. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.

2. Deleting a client after having filtered based on a criteria
   1. Prerequisites: Use the `filter` command with a suitable flag. Multiple clients in the list.
   2. Functions similar to above example except that the indexes to be used are based on the new list shown.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files
   1. Back up the existing `agentassist.json` file under the `data` directory.
   2. Since the data file is corrupted, the application will show a blank list of clients' contacts.
   3. Adding any new contacts now, will override the old file.
   4. You may attempt to repair the old corrupted file, by cross-checking the old corrupted file against the new, uncorrupted file created when a new contact is added after step 3.
   5. Make sure to follow the constraints laid out in the user guide for each attribute of Client.
   6. If the data file is successfully repaired, running `agentassist.jar` should result in the old data being displayed back in the application.
